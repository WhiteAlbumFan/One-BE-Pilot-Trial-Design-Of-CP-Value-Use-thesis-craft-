# One BE Pilot Trial Design Of CP-Value Use(thesis/craft)



This project is mainly about a new idea about ABE (Average Bioequivalence)'s pilot trial design. The contributor is one undergrad and many materials included in this project come from his previous thesis results. Unfortunately he can't share his paper here or at least not before its publication. Now let's see what he does.



At present(20180529), some code emulations($\textbf{R}$) on

1-Fuglsang(2015 $\textbf{Pilot and Repeat Trials as Development Tools Associated with Demonstration of Bioequivalence.}$), 

2-Potvin(2008 $\textbf{Sequential design approaches for bioequivalence studies with crossover designs}$.) 

and 3-Wang (2006 $\textbf{Average Bioequivalence Evaluation: General Methods for Pilot Trials}$)

4-Gould(1995 $\textbf{Group sequential extensions of a standard bioequivalence testing procedure}$)

have been completed and uploaded using R-programming. And additional data-sets by simulations are also uploaded. The author only intends to compare them with his own CP method on some statistics like Type 1/2 error and recall rate and accuracy and so on, and put forward one well-rounded framework to analyses how to design the pilot trial of one ABE evaluation. 



For his own framework, 201807 may be one nice time.
